# UINavigation

UINavigation is a UE4 plugin that allows you to easily setup Navigation within UMG that works with Mouse, Keyboard, Gamepad, or any combination of those. It's designed to be hands-off, flexible and extendable. It features:

    - Changing text color of currently selected option
    - Changing the location of a selector (2D image that indicates which option is currently selected)
    - Changing button states
    - Applying animations (i.e. text size, text offset, etc.)
- Navigation chaining (when holding down a button)
- A functional graphics options menu
- Standard menu examples
- A thorough documentation blueprint
